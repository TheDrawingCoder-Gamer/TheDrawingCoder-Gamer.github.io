## What is Energy?

Energy is the Life Energy that surrounds us on Earth. Life Energy comes from the fact that there is life on Earth -
this energy is all around us in small amounts. 

## What is Energy Binding?

Energy Binding is when one puts a concentrated dose of energy into an item. This is a secretive process, only known
by powerful Energy wielders. Giving a dose of energy to an item is not enough on its own to bind energy into it, 
as experiments by weaker wielders have shown. It's still unknown what exactly is needed to bind.

Bound items that haven't been used yet glow brightly with their magic color. When one picks up an item, its energy begins
to seep into the holder. This can cause the user to unknowingly use the power, which usually causes the room to start to light
up with the magic color. Once the holder wears the item, its life energy pours into its wearer, draining it of all energy, and 
effectively making the wearer an Energy wielder. Unprepared users may unknowingly use its magic to affect their surrondings, 
most likely affecting the room with light again. 

A notable use of these bound items is offloading the effects of using magic onto it. Weak energy users can perform fairly
advanced spells when wearing their bound item, as their body isn't the one handling all of it. Even powerful energy users
sometimes need these items to perform the most powerful spells that could break ones mind without it. A side effect
of this is that if a weak user is performing a spell and someone removes their bound item, all of the magic gets sucked
out through their body, and they may begin to feel unwell, and eventually pass out if they don't stop the spell. 

The reason that these bound items prevent severe effects of energy usage is likely because of the fact that they can amplify
energy. They take a small amount of energy from the body to produce a big effect of energy. It's the same idea of how putting
1000 pounds on glass won't break it, but 1000 pounds on a 1x1 inch peg on glass will. It concentrates the energy through a small area,
giving it a lot of power.

It's worth noting that when left alone, unused bound items may begin to affect their environment in interesting ways. In extreme cases, it's
been noted that they may teleport themselves in an effort to "find an owner", and they may also affect their enviroment by breaking euclidian rules (such as making the inside
of a room larger than its outside.) This is why powerful energy wielders usually contain unused bound items in a field drained of magic. 

## Spells

Of course, with the mention of spells one may wonder what spells there are to offer. It usually depends on the strength on the wielder, but almost anything can be done,
aside from time travelling and other things that break the universe itself. Of course, the more a spell affects, the more strength it requires. 

As stated before, one of the most basic spells is lighting up a room. It's so basic that some new users do it on accident. A next basic spell is telekinesis. 
New users will have to summon hands, as it's sometimes hard to visualize what you want to do without them. However, powerful wielders can use telekinesis 
without summoning hands.

It's also worth noting that most spells require continuous focus to maintain. If one's focus breaks, the spell ends. There are some spells that let one cast spells without
focus, but these spells are notably complex.

Next up in the complexity of spells, are sensory spells. A notable addition to telekinesis is the ability to feel. This is very difficult without using hands, so 
even powerful wielders use hands if they want to feel. There is also magical eye spells. These spells let you move around a magical camera that broadcasts to your mind.
Notably, this spell doesn't require focus to have setup, but it does require focus to tune in to the broadcast. This camera also covers audio. Some wielders just
make a whole head instead of a camera, and that includes smell and taste as well. In combination with telekinesis, you can send your mind to anywhere as long as you
maintain focus.

Slightly more difficult, illusionary spells. These spells make things appear different, but they aren't. They can be as simple as changing the color of an object
to as complex as creating the illusion of a new object. Of course, these changes are intangible. It's impossible to create an illusion with a physical presence. 

More difficult spells include the creation and deletion of objects. It's very difficult to create an object from nothing, and to delete an object into nothing. 
Usually, these two spells must be used in tandem. If they aren't, you will end up having to pay the price in energy. As you may know, mass can become a LOT of energy.
So much to the point where deleting even a tiny object can overload a person with energy. In a similar vain, creating an object drains a lot of energy. Creating
even a tiny object is near impossible. Smart wielders get an object of about equal weight to what they want to make, so they minimize the amount of energy they recieve
or give. This is so common that it has its own name: transmutation. 

It's worth noting that it's still possible to create some objects that have a physical presense with a small amount of energy - the cost is that it stays for a 
very short period of time. This is called conjuring, which is creating physical objects for a short amount of time. The reflection of this is banishment; making
things disappear for a short amount of time. This is useful for entering a place that is blocked off, but both of these require focus to maintain.

The ultimate spell requires extreme fortitude, a bound item, and still might end up making one mad. It allows one to create objects and alter the fabric of history.
It's colloquial name is wish, because that's what it ends up being. It lets one wish for almost anything, but it drains a large amount of energy. It's unadulterated 
creation and deletion, where you can delete the history and create a new one. Very few wielders have ever done this wish, and even fewer have stated that they did.
