It's a new semester. Cliff needs a textbook for his English class. He doesn't really focus on his classes too much, but he still
needs a good grade to be a professional swimmer. He heads over to the library and asks the librarian, if he can buy a textbook. 

Miller is a reader at heart. He is sitting in a chair at the library with one leg lifted up and crossed, with a book in hand. 
He is reading for fun,
but he still has college work to do. He has already bought most of his textbooks, but has been waiting on a book to be in stock.
Then, he gets a notification on his phone:

> The textbook "Advanced Functional Programming" is now in stock

Immediately he gets up. He walks up to the desk and sees Cliff. Cliff is a bit shorter than Miller, but has a strong, muscular build.
His short cut dirty blond hair with his dark blue eyes seems to make Miller want to keep looking. While Cliff is working with the librarian,
he notices Miller looking at him. With eyes now on Miller, he whispers "Hi...". Cliff smiles and says "What's the problem, man?" Miller 
is shivering in fear. He can't just say "Hey you're hot". He pushes through and says "Oh... I was just getting ready to buy a textbook". 
Cliff sizes up Miller. He thinks, he clearly wants to be my friend. He is just having trouble expressing it! Cliff smiles and says 
"Oh, do you want to be friends? What's your name?" Miller's heart races. He has to accept! A chance to learn who Cliff is!

"My name is Miller." 

"Mine is Cliff. Let's meet sometime this week."
