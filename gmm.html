			<p> Whenever I write a UI app I immediately think of Haxe. HaxeUI is my favorite UI framework (and my only UI framework)
			that can compile to javascript, QT (which is what I prefer), GTK, windows, and other targets. It uses css to style (although not 
			to the same extent as html) and in general looks nice. </p>

			<p> An image of QT Gorilla Mod Manager </p>

			I've made a mod manager based off of monke mod manager for all platforms
			(as C# UI, in my experience, almost never runs on linux).

			While in a different language, this is related to modding in general. My <a href="feh.html">Feh EMI mod</a> and <a href="cm.html">Compact Machines port</a>
			for minecraft have a similar idea.
