title: Swing.IO
---

[Swing.IO](https://thedrawingcoder-gamer.github.io/Swing.IO/) is a wrapper around Java
Swing that works in the IO monad. It's based off [Calico](https://www.armanbilge.com/calico/index.html), 
which is a very similar thing but it works on the DOM instead of Swing. I've used it to build
a variation of my [Splatoon 3 Kit Generator](https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer/bubly_kit_generator).
