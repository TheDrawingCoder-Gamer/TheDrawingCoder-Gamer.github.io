			<p> In rust I have written an amiibo generator. It takes an NTAG id, an amiibo id, the keys (it's not illegal to process them,
			illegal to obtain), and outputs a signed amiibo. This was split into two libraries and 1 cli app. I didn't like writing the core library - 
			<a href="https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer/amiitool-rs">amiitool-rs</a> - as it has a <i>lot</i> of cryptography. Cryptography is built such
			that 1 mistake means the whole output is wrong, making it very frustrating to debug. My code was broken <a href="https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer/amiitool-rs/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L153">because of a single byte not written.</a> <a href="https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer/amiigen">Amiigen</a> outputs an unsigned amiibo given an 
			amiibo id. <a href="https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer/amiigen-cli/blob/master/src/main.rs">Amiigen-CLI</a> can do everything the original <a href="https://github.com/socram8888/amiitool">amiitool</a> can do, but it can also generate a raw amiibo or a signed amiibo, given an amiibo id. 
			I have used this to get all splatoon amiibo and legend of zelda amiibo, for the gear in those games.
