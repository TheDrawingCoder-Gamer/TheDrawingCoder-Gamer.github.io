I have a [complete haskell project](https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer/lox-hs) with an 
[incomplete rust bytecode runner](https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer/lox-hs/tree/compiler/lox-vm).
I have learned a lot from this. Someone in the haskell chat pointed out a way to handle interpreting in haskell,
with a faux heap.
