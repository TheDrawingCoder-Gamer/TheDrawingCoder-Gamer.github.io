title: Fabricae Ex Nihilo with EMI
---

[Fabricae Ex Nihilo](https://github.com/LordDeatHunter/FabricaeExNihilo) is a minecraft mod that
adds ways to obtain items that are normally non renewable in vanilla.

[EMI](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/emi) is a mod that lets you view item recipes and a build a calculation
tree that tells you the amount of resoures needed to make a batch of items.

I've written [a mod in scala](https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer/emi-fabricaeexnihlo) that adds compatibility
between these two mods, so you can view Fabricae Ex Nihilo recipes in EMI.

I've also submitted [minor bug fixes](https://github.com/LordDeatHunter/FabricaeExNihilo/pull/25) to Fabricae Ex Nihilo.

This is similar to my [Compact Machines mod](cm.html). They are both minecraft mods, but one has a wider scope.
